# News_Bubblize
A Flutter project focused on creating an app that visually organizes user sumbitted sites, in terms of bubbles. The goal of this project is to practice and further what I have learnt in my software engineering 2 course. Using flutter, dart, git, figma, BDD, & TDD. What I will need to read up on is creating interactive images in flutter & incorporating websites. The one draw back of this project will be, this is an individual project. So I won't be able to communicate coding discourse with others.  

## User Stories

**Story 1** : I open the app, to see the title of the app, *Bubblizer News*. Then a bubble floats up the screen & pops. 

**Story 2** : When the intro screen disappears, local news outlets will de displayed. 

**Story 3** : Each news outlet available will be surronded by a bubble, when selected, the bubble will pop and the top story of that site will appear.

**Story 4** :  To go back to the other news directory, A back button will be available on the top left of the screen. 

**Story 5** : On the bottom of the news directory screen, there should be a button that directs the user to a page to submit their own news site. 

**Story 6** : On the submit page, there should be a text box that the user can type the link to their news site. 

**Story 7** : Pressing submit redirects the user back to the news directory page, and they will see their news outlet in the first bubble section on the top left of the screen.
